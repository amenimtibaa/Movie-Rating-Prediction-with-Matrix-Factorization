# Movie-Rating-Prediction-with-Matrix-Factorization
implementation of Collaborative Filtering based on MovieLens' dataset to Predict the ranting that a user may give to a certain movie.
We used biased stochastic gradient descent based on this paper : 
"Koren, Y., Bell, R., & Volinsky, C. (2009). Matrix factorization techniques for recommender systems. Computer, (8), 30-37"
We used 5-fold cross validation to tune the model.
We achieved 0.942 accuracy (RMSE) on test set.
